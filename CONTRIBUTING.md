# Contributing to ADJSON

Developer tooling lives in the package itself — SwiftPM plugins and committed git hooks — so
there are no shell scripts to run and nothing to install globally.

## One-time setup

Enable the repo's git hooks (pre-commit lint, pre-push test):

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

That's it. The toolchain's bundled `swift format` powers the plugins; no extra tools needed.

## Everyday commands

```sh
swift build                 # build the library
swift test                  # run the test + conformance suite
ADJSON_DEV=1 swift package benchmark   # the ordo-one/benchmark suite (Benchmarks/ADJSONSuite)

swift package format        # format in place  (add --allow-writing-to-package-directory if prompted)
swift package lint          # formatting gate + shipped-library discipline (what CI runs)
swift package fetch-fixtures \
  # downloads JSONTestSuite / JSONPath CTS / simdjson corpora
  # add: --allow-network-connections all --allow-writing-to-package-directory
```

`swift package lint` is the single source of truth for the lint rules: `swift format lint
--strict`, plus the shipped-library discipline (no force-unwrap / force-try / force-cast /
locale-sensitive `strtod` in `Sources/ADJSON`). Fix formatting with `swift package format`.

## Sanitizers

`--sanitize` instruments the whole graph (no manifest change needed). TSan and ASan are
**mutually exclusive**, so run them as separate passes:

```sh
# Tests — race / memory correctness over the full conformance + JSONTestSuite + simdjson corpora
swift test --sanitize=thread                        # data races (buffer pool, metrics)
swift test --sanitize=address --sanitize=undefined  # OOB / use-after-free in the unsafe scanner
```

The test target already drives the large real-world corpora (canada/twitter/citm, JSONTestSuite,
the JSONPath CTS) through the scanner and the shared-state concurrency layer, so `swift test
--sanitize` doubles as the stress harness. These catch what `-enable-actor-data-race-checks`
(actor-isolation only) cannot — the hot paths lean on `Unsafe*Pointer` / `Span`. For coverage-guided
input generation see the **libFuzzer** section below; for throughput numbers use
`ADJSON_DEV=1 swift package benchmark` (never under a sanitizer — ASan changes allocation layout and
TSan is ~5–15× slower, so a sanitized run is a correctness pass, not a measurement).

## Coverage-guided fuzzing (libFuzzer)

The `ADJSONFuzz` target drives `ADJSON.parse` (strict / lenient / json5 / iJSON), lazy navigation,
`JSONValue(parsing:)`, `JSONPath`, and `SQLiteJSONPath` from one `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` entry. It
is gated behind `ADJSON_FUZZ` (so the default `swift build` never tries to link a `main`-less
fuzzer executable) and built with `-sanitize=fuzzer -parse-as-library`.

`-sanitize=fuzzer` is a **Linux** capability of the Swift toolchain (the Darwin SDK rejects it), so
run it on Linux (the CI `fuzz` job does this on every `main` push / dispatch, time-boxed, seeded
from the vendored corpora + CTS):

```sh
ADJSON_FUZZ=1 swift build --target ADJSONFuzz
"$(ADJSON_FUZZ=1 swift build --target ADJSONFuzz --show-bin-path)/ADJSONFuzz" corpus -max_total_time=300
```

A crash writes a `crash-*` reproducer; commit it as a regression test under `Tests/`.

## The `ADJSON_DEV` flag

Heavier dev tooling is gated behind the `ADJSON_DEV` environment variable so that packages which
merely *depend on* ADJSON never resolve it (they keep only swift-syntax, needed by the macro).
Set it when you want:

```sh
# Build-time formatting enforcement (the LintBuild plugin attaches to the ADJSON target):
ADJSON_DEV=1 swift build      # fails the build on any formatting violation

# Generate the DocC documentation (pulls swift-docc-plugin):
ADJSON_DEV=1 swift package generate-documentation --target ADJSON
```

The `format`, `lint`, and `fetch-fixtures` command plugins are dependency-free and work without
the flag. `ADJSON_DEV` also pulls swift-docc-plugin (docs) and swift-collections (only the benchmark
target, for the OrderedDictionary-vs-Dictionary comparison) — neither is ever resolved by consumers.

## Dependencies & `Package.resolved`

The shipped graph is deliberately thin: the library proper depends only on **swift-syntax** (the
`@JSONCodable` / `@Schemable` macros need it), pinned with an `upToNextMajor` `from:` requirement;
the `ADJSONCore` product depends on **nothing**. Everything heavier (docc-plugin, swift-collections,
package-benchmark, the fuzzer) is gated behind `ADJSON_DEV` / `ADJSON_FUZZ` so a package that merely
depends on ADJSON never resolves it.

`Package.resolved` is **gitignored** (the library convention — an application pins exact versions,
a library lets its consumers' resolution win). With the only requirement `from:`-bounded, a checkout
resolves to the latest compatible swift-syntax deterministically without a committed lock file.

## Git hooks

Committed in `.githooks/` and enabled via `core.hooksPath` (above):

- **pre-commit** → `swift package lint` (check-only; blocks the commit on violations).
- **pre-push** → `swift test`.

## CI & documentation

A single workflow — **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — chains everything and only fans out after
the gate passes:

- **`build-test`** (macOS): lint → build → fixtures → test, in one job (one cache, warm build).
- **`platforms`**: a cross-platform compile matrix (iOS / tvOS / watchOS / visionOS), on
  `main` / manual dispatch.
- **`sanitizers`**: TSan + ASan passes over `swift test`, on `main` / manual dispatch — and,
  additionally, on any PR that touches the unsafe scanner (`Sources/ADJSONCore/Core/**`, gated by a
  `dorny/paths-filter` `changes` job). Each pass rebuilds the graph under instrumentation, so other
  PRs stay off the path.
- **`docs`**: builds the DocC site and deploys it to GitHub Pages on `main` —
  <https://g-cqd.github.io/ADJSON/>. Requires Pages source = "GitHub Actions" in the repo
  settings (a one-time manual step).
